## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis reveals that London crime data exhibits complex spatial and temporal patterns typical of urban crime phenomena. The analysis identifies clear hotspots, demonstrates the importance of area-specific factors, and provides robust predictive models for policy applications. The findings support evidence-based policing strategies focused on targeted interventions in high-crime areas while accounting for spatial dependencies and temporal variations.

The econometric analysis confirms the need for sophisticated modeling approaches that account for non-normality, heteroskedasticity, and spatial autocorrelation inherent in crime data. The results provide a solid foundation for advanced spatial-temporal modeling and evidence-based policy recommendations.
