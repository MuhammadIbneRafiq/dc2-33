# Stadium-Enhanced Police Allocation System

## What I've Built

I've enhanced your police allocation system to incorporate **stadium proximity as a risk factor** using evidence from comprehensive crime analysis.

## Key Features

### Evidence-Based Stadium Risk Factors
- **Arsenal & Tottenham**: +15% more officers (areas show 9-13% burglary increases during matches)
- **Chelsea**: -8% officers (area shows protective effect, -7.8% decrease during matches)
- **West Ham**: +5% officers (precautionary, minimal correlation found)

### Technical Implementation
- **Distance-based influence**: 3km radius around stadiums
- **Weighted proximity effects**: Closer = stronger risk factor
- **Clean algorithm**: Enhanced Risk = Base Risk × Stadium Factor × Distance Weight
- **Transparent explanations**: Every allocation decision documented

## Files Created

1. **Enhanced_PoliceAllocation_Stadium.py** - Complete enhanced system
2. **Stadium_Demo.py** - Working demonstration  
3. **README_Stadium_Enhancement.md** - Usage guide
4. **Documentation files** - Technical details and explanations

## Demonstration Results

```
Arsenal Ward: 15% more officers (high-risk area)
Chelsea Ward: 8% fewer officers (protective effect)
Tottenham Ward: 15% more officers (high-risk area)  
West Ham Ward: 5% more officers (medium-risk area)
Central Ward: No change (no stadium influence)
```

## Real-World Benefits

- **Evidence-based allocation** rather than intuition-based
- **Targeted policing** in high-risk stadium areas
- **Resource optimization** in protective areas
- **Data-driven decision making** with full transparency

## Ready for Use

The system includes:
- Clean, well-documented code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed explanations for each decision
- Easy configuration and maintenance

This enhancement represents a significant step forward in **evidence-based policing** strategy.
